# What actually is JavaScript?

- Very versitile language

- Runs in Javascript runtime environment -> Either browser or Node.js (or electronJS for desktop apps)

- Different browsers implement different JS engines. (V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra, JavaScriptCore)

- Provide logic inside environment. (Browser, Node.js)

- Environment provides APIs to interact with DOM, File System, Network, etc.

- JS syntax is derived from Java. (Functional Programming, OOP)

- JavaScript name is a copyright of Oracle. Organization named ECMA International standardized the language. (ECMAScript)
ACTUAL NAME IS ECMASCRIPT, CALLED ES. Then we have more versions ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, ES6.

- TC-39 committee defines the feature of ES.

- Vanilla JavaScript: Simple JavaScript.

- NodeJs: JavaScript runtime environment. (V8 engine) has multiple features. (npm, package manager, etc)

- Angular, React, Vue, etc are frameworks. (React is a library) [Changes in UI are very costly, the reason why GPUs are really expensive] To reduce this cost, we use frameworks. Writes code in JSX. (JSX is a syntax extension to JS) This makes optimised UI changes.


# Types of functions in JS

It is possible to:
- pass a function as an argument to another function
- return a function from a function
- assign a function to a variable
with JS. JS functions are very powerful. They are called first class functions/ citizens.

Refer to function.js for more details.

## Function statement 

```js
function sayHello(param){
    console.log("Hello", param);
}
sayHello(); // invocation
sayHello("World");
sayHello(10);
sayHello([1,2,3,4,5])
sayHello({ name: "Bhavya" })
sayHello(); // this will print "Hello undefined"
```

## Functions are first class citizens 

This means functions are treated as a variable.

```js
let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
let b = a;
console.log(b); // assignment by reference is possible
```
We can directly assign values to a variable.

## Function Expression

```js
let fnContainer = function fn() {
    console.log("I am a function expression");
}
```

Now if we call `FnContainer` it will invoke the `fn` function.

## Anonymous Function

```js
let fnContainer = function () {
    console.log("I am a function expression");
    console.log("I am also an anonymous function");
}
```

Whenever we do not give a name to a function, it is called an anonymous function. (In the above example, the name `fn` wasn't necessary, we could identify it by the name `fnContainer`)

**USAGE:** Higher order functions

## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

Back in the time when we didn't have `let` or `const`, `var` was very troublesome. It was possible to create a global variable by mistake. To avoid this, we used IIFE.

It is like `init()` function in python which is called automatically. (Initialization purposes)

```js
(function fn() {
    console.log("I an IIFE");
    console.log("I will be invoked immediately");
})();
```
> Just need to wrap your functions in round braces and add a pair of round braces at the end => converted into IIFE, called automatically.

**USAGE:** In require, parameter pollution w/o let and const, preserving double pollution, closure (library like Jquery)

## Arrow Function

Many people believe arrow functions are created to simplify the syntax of functions which isnt true.

It is useful in simplyfying the syntax, but also is the backbone of ReactJS. (Helps in binding, using `this` keyword)

```js
let fn = (num) => {
    return num * num;
}
```

> This can be written as:
```js
let fn = num => num * num;
console.log(fn(5));
```

## First Class Citizens

- Functions are treated like variables - can be assigned to variables - **FUNCTION EXPRESSION**

- Can be passed as a parameter - Basis of **Functional Programming**, **Higher Order Functions**, **Callback Functions**, **Everything Async**

- Function can be returned from a function - **Closures**

```js
function sayHello(param){
    console.log("Hello", param);
}

function smaller() {
    console.log("I am smaller");
}

sayHello([1,2,3,4,5]);
sayHello(smaller);
```

## Returning a function from a function

```js
funcion outer () {
    console.log("I am outer returning inner");
    return function inner() {
        console.log("I am inner");
    }
}

let rVal = outer();
console.log("rVal", rVal);
rVal();

```
OUTPUT:
```
I am outer returning inner
Rval [Function: inner]
I am inner
```

We can also convert the returning function into an anonymous function, like:

```js
funcion outer () {
    console.log("I am outer returning inner");
    return function () {
        console.log("I am inner");
    }
}

let rVal = outer();
console.log("rVal", rVal);
rVal();
```

OUTPUT:
```
I am outer returning inner
Rval [Function: (anonymous)]
I am inner
```

# JS Code Execution, Hoisting, and Execution Context

Every JS Code runs inside an Execution Context. (Global Execution Context)

Execution Context is a **wrapper** that supplies the environment and catalysts for the code to be executed.

In Creation Phase, we get:
- Global Object
- This variable
- Code

```js
console.log(global); // in browser we have window object instead of global
console.log(this) // equals an empty object in nodejs environment
// this equals the window object in browser
```

Any object that does not lie inside a function, is called a **Global Code** and lies in the Global Area called the **Global Execution Context**.

**Global Object**
- Node: Global
- Browser: Window Object

**This**
- Global Execution Context: Empty Object
- Browser: Window Object

**Code**
- Memort gets allocated for the code: Undefined (value) => Called **Hoisting**

```js
console.log("a is: ", a);
var a;
console.log("a is: ", a);
a = 10;
console.log("a is: ", a);
```

OUTPUT:
```
a is:  undefined
a is:  undefined
a is:  10
```

## Memory Allocation for Function statements
Memory gets allocated already, even for function.
Heap gets allocated, reference gets stored in a stack, but undefined is not set.

```js
fn();
function fn() {
    console.log("I can be called even before my declaration");
}
```

OUTPUT:
```
I can be called even before my declaration
```

```js
function real() {
    console.log("I am real. Always run me!");
}

function real () {
    console.log("I am fake. Never run me!");
}
function real () {
    console.log("You both are wasted!");
}

real();
```

OUTPUT:
```
You both are wasted!
```

```js
console.log("varName: ", varName);
var varName;
varName = "Captain America";
fn();
function fn() {
    console.log("Hello from fn");
}
fn();
fnContainer();
var fnContainer = function () {
    console.log("I am an expression");
}
```

OUTPUT:
```
varName:  undefined
Hello from fn
Hello from fn
TypeError: fnContainer is not a function
```
